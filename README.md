## Hi! I'm Alisa

I’m a **student developer**, **robotics engineer in training**, and **AI enthusiast** passionate about bridging the gap between **hardware** and **intelligence**.

I’m part of the **Kasimov AI & Robotics Team** at **Korea University**, where we explore how autonomous systems can perceive, learn, and interact with the real world.
Currently, I’m also an **global intern at Daewoong**, working on automation and intelligent control systems — and I serve as a **mentor for international freshmen** at Korea University.

## Research & Technical Focus

My work and interests revolve around the intersection of **robotics**, **embedded systems**, and **AI-driven control**.
I love building systems that *sense, think, and act* — whether that’s through real-time programming, low-level optimization, or natural language interaction.
